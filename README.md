## Logs

### Day 1: Thursday, August 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a React Component that will be used as base for listing items in the application, according to the selected filters. Also wrote my own Unit Tests using Jest and React-Testing-Library (RTL). Starting to understand and get used to automated tests.

**Thoughts:** I've been studying React for the past few weeks, following tutorials and week-long bootcamps. Made some progress, but felt like facing a wall when I got to testing. Starting this challenge worked as a silver lining for organizing my studies, understanding the tools and improving my programming skills. Tests seem too abstract to me, but after starting to write myself some tests, they're gradually making more and more sense. Also tried to apply Test-Driven-Development (TDD), planning tests before really coding components, but I'm not quite sure if I managed to do that.

### Day 2: Friday, August 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today I started working on a private project, as part of a company's technical tests. It'll be my main focus for the next few days. Definitely feeling as going back to square one, and rethinking my way of coding. Quick note on trying to organize my progress in logical commits.

**Thoughts:** Had to kinda of put automated testing aside for a little bit, but it feels like it's going to pay off in the long run. Trying to sharpen my knowledge in some basic things related to React and problem-solving.

### Day 3: Saturday, August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working on the technical tests. Spent many hours dealing with hooks, Redux, CSS and API requests. Things are starting to take form, and I feel some improvements in developing parts of the application logically.

**Thoughts:** It's nice to have learned some tricks with Redux. Still getting used with it, but it's awesome to understand what's going on. I've been trying my best to come up with a pretty and useful interface, but definitelly am going to need some UX classes.

### Day 4: Sunday, August 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the implementation of several functionalities in the application I'm currently developing (still technical tests). Lots of state management and API requests. Looking forward to start testing the components in the next days.

**Thoughts:** Feeling super excited about programming and putting my skills to test. Definitely more confident with what I'm doing, and thinking my next steps logically and carefully.

### Day 5: Monday, August 17, 2020 (logged in the next day)

**Today's Progress:** Spent the day working on styling and structure of my project and some minor fixes.

**Thoughts:** This day was so intense that I completely forgot to log it. In an overall, I'm getting used to coding a lot everyday.

### Day 6: Tuesday, August 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today I jumped into tests. Researched a lot about integration and e2e tests. Wrote my first tests using Cypress, and am looking foward to finish the application I'm working on by the end of the week.

**Thoughts:** Worst day in terms of productivity since the start of the challenge, and also had to handle some personal stuff. But I'm glad with today's progress. Created the base to a lot that's about to come, related to automated tests.
