## Logs

### Day 1: Thursday, August 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Created a React Component that will be used as base for listing items in the application, according to the selected filters. Also wrote my own Unit Tests using Jest and React-Testing-Library (RTL). Starting to understand and get used to automated tests.

**Thoughts:** I've been studying React for the past few weeks, following tutorials and week-long bootcamps. Made some progress, but felt like facing a wall when I got to testing. Starting this challenge worked as a silver lining for organizing my studies, understanding the tools and improving my programming skills. Tests seem too abstract to me, but after starting to write myself some tests, they're gradually making more and more sense. Also tried to apply Test-Driven-Development (TDD), planning tests before really coding components, but I'm not quite sure if I managed to do that.

### Day 2: Friday, August 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today I started working on a private project, as part of a company's technical tests. It'll be my main focus for the next few days. Definitely feeling as going back to square one, and rethinking my way of coding. Quick note on trying to organize my progress in logical commits.

**Thoughts:** Had to kinda of put automated testing aside for a little bit, but it feels like it's going to pay off in the long run. Trying to sharpen my knowledge in some basic things related to React and problem-solving.
